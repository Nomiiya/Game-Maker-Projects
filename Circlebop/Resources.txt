Main Concepts of GM:
	http://fauxoperativegames.com/essential_function_guide/
	Steps:
			1.) Create an obj_mainControl in the room for global Variables
			2.) Create an Init Scripts, scr_initScriptName
						scr_initMacros : a bunch of constant variables that cannot be changed during run time || https://pastebin.com/zAeAkHTD
						scr_initSoundEmitters : a sound effect and music volume control || https://pastebin.com/RpzhK8gR
						(optional) scr_initResolution : handles most of the resolution scaling for the game || https://pastebin.com/er4iyVsf

	* Create an obj_mainControl object
			* This is only for variables that are accessed through multiple objects, multiple times in a single frame.


	* Make sure to start using the prefix obj_ || spr_ and other prefixes.

	* Instanced vs Global Variables
				x += h_speed;
				totalDistanceTravelled += h_speed;
				speedAtCheckPoint = h_speed;

				^^^ Slower than ^^^^

				var _hSpeed = h_speed;
				x += _hSpeed ;
				totalDistanceTravelled += _hSpeed ;
				speedAtCheckPoint = _hSpeed ;

   * Switch Statements vs If Statements
	 			Usually SWITCH > IF unless there are only two situations

	 * Init Scripts
	 			Constant values with no name syntax, try to name constant variables with ALL CAPS
